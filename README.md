## ✨ Core Features

*   🌌 **Classic Arcade Action**: Dodge and shoot your way through waves of asteroids in a retro-inspired space environment.
*   🌠 **Dynamic Asteroids**: Asteroids of various sizes spawn continuously. Larger asteroids split into smaller, faster fragments when shot.
*   🚀 **Responsive Ship Controls**: Utilize thrust and rotation for precise maneuvering through hazardous debris.
*   💯 **Scoring System**: Earn points for every asteroid destroyed. Smaller, more agile fragments yield higher scores:
    *   Large Asteroid: 25 points
    *   Medium Asteroid: 50 points
    *   Small Asteroid: 100 points
*   🛡️ **Lives & Game Over**: Start with a set number of lives. Lose them all by colliding with asteroids, and it's game over!
*   🔄 **Screen Wrapping**: Fly off one edge of the screen and seamlessly reappear on the opposite side.
*   ⏳ **Respawn Invulnerability**: Gain a brief period of invincibility after losing a life, giving you a chance to reorient.
*   💥 **Explosive Feedback**: Visual particle effects accompany asteroid and player ship explosions.
